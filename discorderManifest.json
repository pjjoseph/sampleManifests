The band tends\nto try a little too hard, the\naudience still worries if they\nhave used enough Joy-Gel,\ntaken the wrong amount of the\nright drugs. Too much apprehension for me. So I wait\nuntil I hear the opening\nstrains of \"We're Desperate\"\nbefore I enter the ballroom.\nIt's electric. My feet start\nhopping, my spine is tingling.\nThe audience stands calm,\nVancouver laid back. I don't\ncare to be cool -- gotta dance,\ngotta move. X is in town, and\nmy ears ring with the\nchallenge.\nExene stands wrapping\nherself around her mike, like\nsome red-haired modern-day\nMedusa. The energy with\nwhich she bends her voice\nagainst John Doe's takes her\nconcentration, rivets her feet.\nBilly stands back, playing\nwild, standing easy, grinning\nslow like some blonde, baby-\nfaced James Dean. And John\nbouncing his bass, dancing,\npulling it all together. His\nvoice croons half screams into\nthe crowd. Hot, hot, hot.\nX, a study in contradictions.\nPunky, yes, rockin', yes. But\nthere are strains of country\nand western, sixties rock,\neven rockabilly. The American\nroots are there, but the lyrics\ncut hard at the American\ndream. Hey, John Doe, what's\ngoing on?\n\"To me, the American\ndream is to be able to get a job\nand live. But you get all the\nredneck nationality. I always\nsee the typical American as\nbeing a farmer who could\ncome to an X concert without\never hearing anything of punk\nrock and saying, 'Goddam\nthose guys sure play fast, but\nthey're sure having fun and\nthese kids are having fun.\nThat's okay with me.' That\nkind of open-mindedness.''\nThe band is aware of the\ncontradictions. Doe notes that\nhe feels that the clash between the music and the lyrics\nis their main strength. For\nhim, the roots are real. Then,\nhe reflects on his government.\n\"I feel fine about the\npeople. But the government\nwon't respond. Like the\nCentral American thing.\nThere hasn't been a group of\npeople who have been able to\ntap the American sentiment.\nOverwhelmingly, the American people want to leave those\npeople alone, let them get\ntheir farms together and live.\nObviously the government\nwants to see it differently.\"\nBut Doe feels there\nlimits to a rock band's poli\neffectiveness. \"You have a\nchoice between playing music\nor becoming one of the Vancouver Five. I feel you have to\nmake that choice. You can't do\nboth, you can't be a politician\nwith a guitar. Except you can,\nraise a few people's\nconsciousness.\n\"I think it's a real slow\nchange in America. With all\nthe protests, we did eventually get out of the Vietnam\nwar. And you can buy wheat\nbread in the supermarkets\nnow.\"\nUltimately, X prefers a personal politic. Their songs are\nadmittedly autobiographical.\n'Exeneand I go through all\nsorts of weird things. The\nsongs are just made .i litile\nmore surreal. We just make\nthem a lot better or a lot\nworse. Just a lot more of\nwhatever it is.\"\nBut it all comes back to\nmusic. And though we baited\nthe category hook, John Doe\nrefused to bite.\n\"When the term punk came\nto be, it meant anything that\nwasn't Peter Frampton. When\nit all started out, people were\nlistening to bands as diverse\nas the Talking Heads, the\nRamones and Blondie. One\nwas an art band, another a\nrock and roll band, and the\nother a pop group. But they\nwere all punk because they\nwere different from the mainstream. Now punk doesn't\nmean anything, except people\nconstrue punk to mean hard-\n\"I think we sell records\nfaster. But they end up selling\nthe same amount. We are\nable to tour a little more\ncomfortably because they can\nadvertise and get more people\nout to the gigs.\n\"But the radio stations still\ndon't notice us. It's involved\nwith the Nazi politics they call\nformatting, going from Styx,\nJourney and Foreigner and\nthen pulling a switch and\ngoing to country and western.\nIf that doesn't work, then they\ntry Duran Duran and A Flock\nof Seagulls. It's just that\nsingle mindedness that drives\nme nutty.\n\"We are getting some more\nexposure, even on the occasional FM chart, but it's still\nmostly the college stations,\nnon-commercial stuff and\npublic support.\"\ncore, which is something you\ndo, like D.O.A., when you\nfirst start out and you want to\nplay as loud and as fast as you\ncan.\"\nAnd certainly X started out\nplaying loud and fast. They\nstill do it as well as any in\nthe business. But the roots are\nalways there, and perhaps\nbecause of this respect for a\nbroader musical spectrum,\nthey are one of the few\nalternative bands to get picked up by a major label. Above\nthe din of those crying \"Sell\nout!\" we asked Doe what this\nhas meant to the band.\nFXV\nSo, John Doe, where does X\ngo from here?\n\"I really wish I knew,\nbecause we're supposed to be\nrecording a record. Exene\nand I have written a couple of\nsongs that are real personal.\nX's records have been going\nbummer, fun, bummer, fun\nSo I guess we're up for a\nbummer with the next one.\n\"We might record the\nTroggs' 'Wild Thing.' We did\nit for a whim at a gig in Los\nAngeles, and a couple of guys\nin the record company went\nwild. They think it'll be a big\nhit. I don't care. I'll record it.\nThe guy who engineers and\nproduces Scorpions is going to\ndo it when we get back.\"\nBack at the concert I'm still\nshaking, but the band is\ngetting distracted. A wall of\nspit forces Billy back to the\nsafety of the shadows at the\nback of the stage. Exene\nreminds the crowd that 1976\nwas some years ago. Her\ncomplaint is greeted with one\nparticularly well-placed gob.\nOne more song, and the band\nleaves the stage.\nA chant of \"no spit\" rises\nfrom voices frustrated from\ntoo many years of misplaced\nconcert machismo. For several\nminutes the situation remains\ntense and tenuous. Finally, a\nsense of mutual order is\nestablished, and the band\nreturns. After a brief \"Thank\nyou\" from Exenei, the band\nplays again like this place, this\ncrowd, this song is all that\nmatters.\nLater in the dressing room,\nI ask John Doe about the\nincident. \"I feel like I'm being\na Dad,\" he moans, \"but it\nwas a good show, wasn't it?\"\nExene offers a different\ncommentary. \"What I think I\ndidn't do was be like a Dad. I\ndidn't talk like I was a parent.\nI talked like I was somebody in\na bar and had just gotten spit\non. If I was in that hall tonight\nand I was drinking a beer and\nsome guy came up to me and\nspit in my face, my fist would\ngo back ana I would hit him.\"\nI dare to suggest that she\nhandled the whole thing with\nsome degree of class, and\nExene bristles. \"There's one\nthing I don't know nothing\nabout, I don't know nothing\nabout class. I just recognized\nthe situation and decided, as\nshy as I am, really, I better do\nsomething.\n\"But there's nothing you\ncan say, really. Especially\nwhen you tell people not to\nspit, and they keep spitting on\nyou. 'OK, well, make fun of\nme. Fine.'\"'And so X walked\noff stage. Nothing new for\nExene .\n\"We do that all the time.\nAnytime someone causes\ntrouble, we leave until the\nproblem is solved. We just\ndon't play under those conditions.\"\nOften that kind of confrontation between audience and\nperformer can rip a show\napart. But for X it seemed like\nthe moment passed and the\nenergy inherent in their sound\njust ahd to take over. Exene\nis quick to explain.\n\"That's the way we are, you\nknow. When the song that\nwe're doing is being played,\nthat's all we care about.\"\nDavid Firman cinn^DiSfccmpER\nfffllOS Cable 100\nLayout\nChris Dafoe\nFiona MacKay\nAdvertising:\nDave Ball\nHarry Hertscheg\nContributors\nCD\nJason Grant\nFiona MacKay\nDean Pelkey\nRobin Razzel\nSteve Robertson\nJaphy Ryder\nMichael Shea\nRobSimms\nDistribution\nHarry Hertscheg\nDISCORDER is a monthly paper publisher by the Student Radio Society of\ne University of British Columbia.

V6K 1R2, Phone 734-2828\nDear Airhead,\nAt the current Corsage concert a very disturbing incident\noccurred which prompted me\nto write. A friend of mine was\nroughed up, thrown down the\nstairs, and forcibly ejected\nfrom the building due to some\nsimple misunderstanding. A\nperson who was trying to\nenter with a beer was pushed\ninto my friend by a security\ngoon; the beer was spilt on my\nfriend who then uttered an\nexpletive, and the goon\nwrongly assumed it was directed at him. Attempts to\nexplain -proved futile as my\nfriend was being thrown down\nthe stairs. Appeals to the\nother security goons resulted\nin statements such as, \"We\nleave him alone; he's a\npsycho; do what he says.\" As\nCITR promoted the event, I\nfeel it is your responsibility to\ncontrol the security goons who\nare supposedly controlling the\ncrowd. I am very disappointed\nthat something such as this\ncould have occurred, and I\nexpect it to be looked into. It\nwould seem that the policy of\nyour security goons is: Hit\nfirst, ask questions later (if. at\nall).\nA very disillusioned CITR fan.\nI sympathize with your concerns, but I must inform you\nthat CITR does not \"promote\" events, in the sense\nthat we act as a booking agent\nor production company.\nGenerally, our involvement is\nlimited to promotion in an\n\"on-air\" context. Thus, the\nsecurity \"goons\" are not ours\nand they are outside CITR's\njurisdiction. We do, however,\ndeplore the notion that a\nsecurity badge is a license for\nviolence.\nDear CITR\/Discorder:\nI have been listening to\nCITR for about one year now,\nsince I moved to Vancouver\nfrom San Francisco. I think\nyour station is fantastic! The\nradio in Vancouver, except for\nyou guys, has to be the worst\nthat any large North American\ncity has.\nThe only complaint I have is\nthat your signal is so weak and\nis not stereo. I would gladly\npay a fee every year in\norder to fund your signal\nexpansion, and my auess  is\nthat a lot of other people\nwould, too. Say, $25-$30 a\nyear.\nI find myself extremely\nfrustrated every time I try to\ntune into your station. If I\nmove around in my living\nroom while listening to CITR,.\nthe signal dies! I have to be\nsitting down in order to enjoy\nit. And, you must agree,\nthat's ridiculous.\nI would also like to see\nDiscorder give info on what's\ngoing to be on your station. In\nthe I BRAINEATER issue, all\nthere was was a box which\nwas so confusing it was useless. What album and artist\nfeatures are going to be on\nthis week? I don't know. Why\ndon't you list them in the\npaper?\nWell, that's about all I have\nto say. Keep up the good\nwork. I love the station and so\ndo a lot of others.\nYours truly,\nTed Thomas Jr.\nP.S.  You should  also go 24\nhours . . . stopping at 1 a.m. is\nterrible.\nDear Airhead,\nFUCK!\nNow that I have your attention, I'm getting sick and tired\nof all the asshole jocks around\ncampus! I went down to the\nPit downstairs of the S.U.B.,\nand you wouldn't believe all\nthe jerks down there! Football\njocks, by the hundreds! And\nthey got the I.Q. of a piece of\nfurniture. They all got their\ncutesy little fag bags! And\nt-shirts advertising some faggot football or hockey team.\nAnd the worst thing about it,\nthese macho shits look like\nthey had a tire pump shoved\nup their asses and been blown\nup. I walked in there wearing\nmy punk outfit, and at least 20\ndozen eyes gawk at me for\nabout 5 minutes. Why can't\nthey just grow up and accept\nthe fact that we are here if\nthey like it or not!\nYour faithful reader,\nJoey Meat rack\nAirhead,\nI look at your \"Top 50\" in\nthe February issue and can't\nhelp noticing how guitar-oriented and familiar most of\nthe artists are. It seems such a\nshame that CITR presents the\nopportunity to expose truly\ninnovative and exciting new\nmusic and yet offers a top ten\nthat includes the likes ot\nD.O.A., Iggy Pop, X,\nJonathan Richman, Cramps,\netc. \u2014 all worthy acts but\nstagnant as hell compared\nwith what is really HAPPENING -- RIGHT NOW at the\nforefront of today's music\nscene. I am now referring to\nbands like Portion Control,\nLegendary Pink Dots, Nocturnal Emessionsand Einstur-\nzende Neubaten to namevr\nzende Neubaten to name just\na few (none of whom can be\nfound on your Top 50).\nI believe your own Mark\nMushet is well aware of the\nimportance of these artists,\nand so I hereby nominate him\nas the new program director\nfor the station. Perhaps then\nCITR might have some vitality, foresight and impact,\ninstead of dwelling on all\nthese tired old guitar rock\nincarnations, few of which\nwere even new three years\nago, let alone now.\nYours sincerely,\nGreg Rum\nPersonally, I'm partial to\nHousehold Appliances, if only\nbecause they're willing to gig\nin my kitchen whenever I'm\nhungry; and anything on the\nBlack & Decker label -- home\nof the hits, as we handyman\nhipsters well know.\nJust  say  O.V.,   Joey,\nthey'll leave you alone.\nand\nFor the second month in a row\nDiscorder is not terribly . . .\nThrilling. 54-40 sucks. The\nstandout track is Jonathan\nRichman. Japanese fashions .\n. . UCK. . .\nDear Airhead,\nDiscorder is cool, but it\nneeds more ads. How come\nstores like Zulu and Odyssey\ndon't advertise? They\nwouldn't be around if it\nweren't for you guys (CITR)!\nWhy don't you tell that?\nI agree; obviously, I'm slightly\nbiased. However, if you check\nout back issues of Discorder\n[admittedly scarce], you'll\nfind that Zulu has advertised\nin almost every issue. Branford Marsalis - A Big Brother Talks\nBran ford Marsalis, 23, is\nsaxophonist in the Wynton\nMarsalis Quintet, probably\nthe most successful jazz group\nin America today. Led by his\n22-year-old brother, the band\nhas recorded 2 critically-\nacclaimed albums, \"Wynton\nMarsalis\" and \"Think of\nOne\", and this year Branf ord\nwill be releasing his own solo\nproject. I talked with Bran ford\nduring the Quintet's recent\n10-day stint at the International Plaza Hotel.\nLet's first talk about your\nown album - what's that\ngoing to be like, and who's\non it?\nThe guys in Wynton's band\n- part of it -- Jeff Watts,\nKenny Kirkland, and there's a\nyoung 16-year-old bass\nplayer, he's a phenom:\nCharnett Moffett, he's incredible. And Ron Carter, drummer Smitty Smith, and Mul-\ngrew Miller, who plays with\nArt Blakey now - that's most\nof the people.\nAre you doing any writing for\nthis record?\nYeah, yeah! I got three\ntunes on it, which is a milestone for me, considering\nthat I've never written anything at any time in my life\nbefore. And I hope people like\nthem. A couple of the tunes I\nlike, one's all right. One was\neasy, I just played. It was fun.\nThe whole album was fun. It'll\nbe out next month, too. Save\nall your nickels and dimes,\nfolks, don't go to the movies,\nput it in a little piggybank with\nmy name on it; when the\nalbum comes out, buy it. The\nname of the album is \"Scenes\nin the City\". The album cover\nis absolutely bizarre, I think\nyou'll like it. I mean, it doesn't\nlook like a Nina Hagen album,\nor Ozzy Osborne with dead\npigs all over and stuff, but for\njazz, I guess it's unusual.\nAre there differences between you and Wynton as far\nas your personalities go?\nYeah, I think so. He's a very\nintense guy. I mean, to do the\nthings that he's done in such a\nshort span of time, you have to\nhave a certain intensity to\nward off all the wolves who try\nto get to you and confuse you.\nThere's a lot of pressure on\nhim in what he does, what\nhe's doing. Four different\nGrammy nominations in two\nsections of music ~ that's\npretty demanding. I tend to be\nmore laid back. Things don't\nbother me that much.\nDo you think Wynton's\ndeveloped as a band leader?\nOh yeah, a lot. I mean,\nleaps and bounds. His command over the band changes\nas time goes by; he grows into\nit every day the more that he\ndoes it. He's become a lot\nmore relaxed about it. There\nused to be a point where\npeople would say, \"He lets\nthe band play too long.\" Well,\nwe can play for a million\nyears; when he's playing, you\nknow whose band it is.\nSo what do you say to a\ncritic who suggests that you 're\nfree-loading on Wynton's\nsuccess?\nI say thank you. I don't\nknow. I mean, in a way I am.\nBut people are family-oriented. They want to sell a story,\nthey'll latch onto something.\nYou know, a great trumpet\nplayer's a good story, but a\ngreat musical family's a bigger story. They don't say,\n\"The Wynton Marsalis Quintet\", they say, \"The Wynton\nMarsalis Quintet with his\nbrother Branford on saxophone\". I didn't walk up to\nhim and slip a dollar in his\nhand and say, \"Hey buddy,\nwhy don't you put my name in\nthat paper?\" I wake up in the\nmorning, and it's in there.\nIt's like Wynton; he wasn't\nin high school saying,   \"One\nday I'm going to be a star.\"\nHe said, \"One day I'm going\nto get a record contract.\" He\nknew that. And he was right.\nHe started playing music because he loved it. I play the\nmusic because I love it and I\nlove playing in my brother's\nband.\nHow old are your other\nbrothers, and are they going\ninto music?\nEllis, the 19-year-old's a\nlaw student at NYU. The\n12-year-old's autistic, so he\nwon't be playing much of\nanything. Delpheayo is the\n18-year-old, he's at Berklee\nCollege of Music right now,\nplaying the trombone; he's\neither going to play music or\nbe an engineer. He has a lot of\nproduction plans and things\nlike that.\nAnd Jason is the boy\nwonder; he's the child\nprodigy. He's seven years old,\nhe has perfect pitch, total\nrecall and he plays three\ninstruments -- drums, piano,\nviolin. You can put on any\nrecord, I mean, you can\nput on a Miles Davis record\nand say, \"This is Clifford\nBrown,\" he'll say, \"No, that's\nMiles Davis.\" When I was\nseven years old, I could have\ncared less, let alone actually\nhave known it. And he has a\ntremendously  high   IQ   .   .   .\nHe's  a  genius.

It's not meant as an    learning the same things at\ninsult, it's just that if everybody was a leader, then the\nleaders wouldn't be anything.\nMost people are followers,\nand that's cool. That's what\nmakes jazz and classical music\nso eclectic.\nOf course, we have to talk\nabout what jazz records you\nlistened to when you first\nstarted playing jazz - the all-\nimportant ' 'influences\"\nguestion.\nCharlie Parker, then I got\ninto Miles Davis.

I was just so\nafraid to play it because so\nmany people try, and his\nmusic's so strong that they\nfail;   they   just   sound   like\nthe same time, with nobody to\nlean on ... it would be stupid.\nAnd now we're together, and\nas things happen! can be\nthere if he needs me, and I'm\ngetting a first-hand view of\nthings without having my neck\non the chopping block.

It\nmust rank as one of the most\nhideous examples of cover art\nI've ever had the displeasure\nof seeing. A friend even went\nso far as to say that it was\nworse than the Vancouver\nCanuck's logo...(True!)\nHowever, despite Sparkie in\nthe Rain's decidedly unorthodox album cover, I'm sorry to\nsay that from a musical standpoint the album is anything\nbut.\n''Conventional'' about\nsums it up: Simple Minds\nhave decided they want to be\nliked, preferably and particularly by commercial radio. To\nbe accurate, that decision\nappeared to have been made\nseveral releases ago with Love ,.\nSong, their first Canadian\nTop-40 single. Their musical\nstrategy has remained the\nsame since. Sparkle in the\nRain merely takes their desire\nanother step further.\nListening to this album is a\nlittle like eating Cream of\nWheat the day after you've\nhad four impacted wisdom\nteeth pulled: you may not\nactually enjoy it for its' own\nsake, but it slips down the\nthroat without  having  to  be\nchewed. Sparkle in the Rain\nsuffers from similar bland-\nness. A little more contrast --\nand a little less cloying drama\n\u2014 would have made the\ndifference, would have lent\nsome bite to their material.\nSteve Lillywhite got his\nhands on this one and his lush\nproduction has much to do\nwith Simple Minds' conspicuous and disconcerting resemblance to the bands Big\nCountry and U2. It is bound to\nbe argued that Peter Walsh\ndid a far more interesting job\nwith their last LP New Gold\nDream But the purpose of\nhiring Lillywhite as producer\nthis time around seems plain\n~ to make Sparkle in the Rain\na BIG SUCCESS. His stamp of\napproval, however, may mean\nthe kiss of death in music's\nalternative circles.\nFrom Pop to Progressive to\nDanceable to Hugely Successful -- is that the Simple Minds\nmaster play? Maybe that's an\nobvious question with an\nequally obvious answer. And\nperhaps the question of\naccessibility as a musical\nvirtue is naive. Still, the\nconsensus concerning Sparkle\nin the Rain may be that Simple\nMinds are trying too hard in\nthe wrong direction and have\nlost the more important\nquality of individuality in the\nprocess.\nIdealism aside, let us conclude that Simple Minds are\nplaying ball with the big boys\nnow. I still might be moved to\ngo home and play Sparkle in\nthe Rain at full blast while\nI'm cooking dinner in the next\nroom. Why? Precisely because it IS reasonably likable,\ncertianly easy to listen to, and,\nprinciples aside, more or less\ninoffensive. Something to\ndance to while you mince the\nonions. It is \u2014 unfortunately --\nNOT an album to be taken\nseriously.\nRobin Razzel\nGolden\nPalominos\nGolden Palominos\nThis album fs a collaboration of six musicians who are\nreally making moves in the\nNew York music scene. Anton\nFier, Arto Lindsay, Bill\nLaswell, David Moss, John\nZorn and Jamaaladeen\nTacuma have been making\nappearances as The Golden\nPalominos for about a year\nand a half now; this is the\nfirst time they've put their\nmusic on record. The result is\na successful mix of 1970s\navant-garde rock and 1980s\nOrnette Coleman-style funk,\nwith a hefty dose of that rare\nspice, \"danceability.\" This is\nnot a trendy pop album, but\nfor those who will take the\nchance, there are a lot of\nsurprising, eclectic ideas to be\nfound in this band's music.\nAnton Fier and Arto\nLindsay are credited with\nmost of the compositions; Fier\nis known for his drumming\nwith the Lounge Lizards, The\nFeelies, Pere Ubu and David\nThomas and The Pedestrians,\nwhile Lindsay was the leader\nof DNA (see the \"No New\nYork\" LP). Laswell provides\nthe   swirling  bass sounds\nthroughout, doubling up with\nTacuma -Ornette's band- on\ntwo tracks. David Moss donates such interesting things as\n\"non-rhythmic percussion\"\nand \"Bertola Sound Sculptures, '' and Zorn is on alto sax,\nclarinet and game calls (more\nabout those later). Also present are Fred Frith and\nMichael Beinhorn (Material\nkeyboardist).\nWith such an eccentric\nbunch as this, one might\nexpect an album of esoteric\nmeanderings through the outer realms of musical mayhem.\nFortunately, the combination\nof talent here has managed to\navoid excess. The tracks on\nthis  LP are all  5-7   minutes\nlong, but the musicianship i\nso tight that the tunes rid*\nalong without making the\nlistener strain to understand\nwhat's happening. It's like\nbeing in a very noisy disco\nwatching videos of Mutual of\nOmaha's Wild Kingdom.\n(That's where the game calls\ncome in: bees, horses, you\nname it, it's there somewhere.)\nA novel concept... if this is\nthe kind of music you've been\nitching to hear, trot on down\nto your local disc emporium\nand buy this album.\nESG\nCome Away\nI wanted to tap my foot. I\nwanted the room to vibrate. I\njust wanted to DANCE, god-\ndamit! ESG make it so easy;\nthey play music that even your\nbones can hear.\nCome Away is an album for\npeople who take their writhing seriously. No pseudo-im-\nspiring swirling synth overtures to grimace through\nwhile we wait for this week's\npop star to invoke his all to\noften impotent muse. ESG cut\nright to the heart of the matter\nusing only the most basic\ningredients.\nThis album is dominated by\nbass - chunky, throbbinh,\nthoroughly overpowering\nbass. A variety of percussive\ndevices --congas, cowbells,\nand vibraslap-- embellish the\nsolid backbone of the bass\nline, with just the occasional\npinch of guitar or synthesizer thrown into the recipe for\natmospheric effect. Voila, the\nsound of ESG.\nESG is truly an R & B family\naffair. The four Scroggins\nsisters   -Renee, Valerie,\nMarie and Deborah-- handle\nbass, guitar, drums and miscellaneous percussion with\nTito Labran banging the congas. All the girls do some\nsinging, although Renee assumes the greater part of the\nvocal chores.\nBut what's the message,\nyou ask? What colour is ESG's\nhigh horse? Come Away is a\nsimple, happy exhortation to\ntranscend mundane reality in\nthe easiest way possible ~\ndancing. Even those of us\nwho, for one reason or another, aren't overly fond of\ngetting up on the dance floor\nand really babooning in, will\nbe hard pressed not to pulsate\nto the sound of ESG.\nDoldrums? Come Away is an\nextremely therapeutic record\n-with no side effects.\n Steve Robertson\n2KJW\nVANCOUVER'S NEWEST!\nRECYCLED  APPAREL\nClassic   to  Contemporary\nopen 7days\n683*0080\n221\ncarrall   st.\ngastown\nRealistic Prices\nKing Kurt\nOoh Wallah Wallah\nCow noises! They got cow\nnoises I tell you, right at the\nend of one song. And fiddles,\nnot just guitars and drums,\nbut fiddles. And listen to\nthese names: The Smeg,\nMaggot, Thwack, Rory, John,\nand Robert.\nCollectively they're known\nas King Kurt, a band of sorts,\nand how they got Dave\nEdmunds to produce them I'll\nnever know. Anyway, their\nrecord is called Oohwallah-\nwallah and the more I listen to\nit the more I feel that...well...\nit's just not serious!\nFor instance, look at the\npicture on the back of the\nalbum cover; six idiots with\nfunny haircuts leaning over\neach other with their chins\noutstretched. These are definitely six guys who you\nwouldn't want to take to a\nformal dinner with an old and\nproper aunt. They'd probably\nend up drinking champagne\nout of shoes and wearing\nlampshades on their heads.\nAnd as for the record, well\nit sounds just as goofy as\nthese guys look. Try to\nimagine a barbershop quartet\non bennies all set to a speeded\nup 4\/4 beat with trival drums\nan led by a guy with a mutated\nTexas accent. No ordinary\nrock band would dare sound\nlike this, but then again, no\nordinary rock band would\ninclude covers of \"Mack the\nKnife,\" \"Ghost Riders in the\nSky,\" and \"When the Saints\nGo Marching IN\" all on one\nalbum.\nI don't know, somewhere\ndown   the   line   these   guys\ndecided they were only in the\nmusic business for fun and\ndamn it, it's contagious!\nListen to the single,\nDestination Zululand; if it\ndoesn't get you bouncing off\nthe furniture nothing will.\nSo what I want to know is:\nwho told these guys life was\nall fun and games? They act\nlike they can just stagger off to\nany old place and have a\nparty, so what if they've got\nthis record to back them up? I\ndon't want fun and I don't\ncare how many times I hear\nthis record. I'm a serious,\nmature person. I want\nmeaningful music. So there.\nDum di dum de dum\t\noohwallahwallah oowallah-\nwallah dance to the zulu beat.\nOh damn it, I'm hooked.\nDean \"Rock and Roll is a\nSerious Business\" Pelkey John Cale\nCarribean   Sunset\nAlien Sex Fiend\nWho's Been Sleeping\nm my Brain\nDear Uncle CD,\nPlease help me! I'm confused! You see, all of my friends\nhave been telling me about\nthis new band from England,\nAlien Sex Fiend. Some of\nthem say that these guys are\nnew, revolutionary, and exciting music that's happening\nRIGHT NOW! The others say\nthat ASF are nothing but a\nbunch of rip-off hype trendy\nwankers. I borrowed the record, and I can't see what all\nthe fuss is about. Am I clued\nout or what?\nYour loving nephew,\nRobin\nDon't worry, you're not\nalone. I can't fkgure what all\nthe fuss is about, either.\nJeffery Lee Pierce calls these\nguys \"Batcave Assholes;\"\nothers tout them as the Next\nBig Thing. As far as I can see,\nit's really just another case of\nthe Brits stealing American\nideas (see: punk, rock 'n roll,\netc.), repackaging them, and\nselling 'em back to the Americans at inflated prices.\nASF are TRASH: skulls,\nbones, ghoulish make-up, horror movie lyrics, nasty sounding guitar, no bass. In short,\nthe whole shebang. This is the\ngood news. TRASH is fun!\nAnd so, I suppose, are ASF,\nbut only to a point. Y'see, ASF\nare not particularly inspired\nTrash; I get the feeling that\nthey haven't seen either \"Hot\nRods from Hell\" or \"Riot on\nSunset Strip\" (two films essential to the true appreciation\nFelt\nSplendor of fear\nIt is a wet, foggy day, and\nyou hear the sweet strains of\nmusic as you stroll along the\nSeawall in Stanley Park. The\nsource of the sounds is a\nsmall, wood-carved speaker\nnear a large, damp log. You\nlie down on the clammy sand\nand rest your head against the\nlog; you close your eyes and\nlisten to the music; the quiet,\ngentle music.\nSoon, you find yourself\nfloating slowly over the sea;\ncascades of sleepy guitar lines\nfill your ears, a heavy, understated drum thuds carefully in\nthe background, always in the\nbackground. A dreamy, plaintive voice (the name Lou Reed\nsprings to mind) with a slight\naccent breaks to the surface,\nthen subsides quickly, to return again only once.\nAll this time, you remain\nunmoved. The music is never\nhappy, but remains somewhat\ngloomy, not unlike the weath\ner you are experiencing. You\nsnap out of the almost hypnotic state to find an album in\nfront of you: \"FELT-The\nSplendor of Fear,\" it says.\nYou vaguely recall a pair of\nsongs by this group that you\nheard in another life (or was it\non CITR?), but you seem to\nremember them as being\nmore interesting than this.\nWhile the last guitar notes\nfade away, your mind is\ncleared of the haze and focuses once again. You now remember two singles, \"Penelope Tree\" and \"My Face is\non Fire, \" and an LP,\n\"Crumbling the Antiseptic\nBeauty;\" but the lingering\nfeeling that this album isn't\nquite as good remains. \"It\nwould be nice music to fall\nasleep to,\" you think, trying\nto find a reason to spend some\nmoney on this LP, \"But then\nagain. ..\"\nSuddenly, the album cover\nturns to dust in your hands\n-and your doubts leave with\nit- \"Maybe I don't like this\nweather after all. . .\"\nYou get up -and start\nwalking again- your mind,\nand your wallet, at ease.\nJaphy Ryder\nof TRASH).\nTo be blunt, Robin, Alien\nSex Fiend sound like A Flock\nof Seagulls trying to be the\nCramps.\nNow, you might say this is\nnot necessarily a bad thing. I\nmean, it beats the Flock trying\nto sound like themselves. But\nAlien Sex Fiend fall short of\nthe inspired Trash of the\nCramps, the wit and originality that make the Cramps the\nmost wonderful band this side\nof an acid flash-back.\nWhat ASF give us is a\nthud-dance beat, some groaning haunted-house synthesizer, some uninspired noise\nguitar and a bunch of reedy\nwhining on topics chosen from\nwhat Alien Sex Fiend suppose\nto be the seamier side of life.\nIt's decadence worn like a pair\nof deliberately torn fishnet\nstockings.\nSo, Robin, don't worry, you\naren't as clued out as your\nfriends might think. Who's\nBeen Sleeping in My Brain? is\na remarkably sexless piece of\nvinyl. Seek your Trash elsewhere.\nYour loving uncle,\nCD\nThis is Cale's twelfth record\nin his post-Velvet Underground career and follows last\n\/ear's outstanding Music for a\nNew Society. The good thing\nabout Cale's music is that\neven his most asinine songs\nare much better than most\nmusic released today, and\neven his duff albums have a\nfew good tracks on them.\nHaving said this, I must say\nthat Caribbean Sunset is a\nduff album, especially musically. It is definitely not up to\nCale's usually very high\nstandards. Cale does three\nthings beautifully: piano ballads, experimental music, and\nincredibly violent thrash. This\nalbum does not contain these.\nThere are three major problems with this album:.\n1) There is too much synthesizer, especially when Cale is\ntrying to be aggressive. Much\nof it is LAME and so repetitive\nthat it sounds like a Loverboy\nbacking track.\n2) The guitar is mixed too\nfar down to be effective,\nespecially on songs like Model\nBeirut Recital, Praetorian Underground,   and    The   Hunt,\nwhose lyrics, bass and drums\nindicate that Cale is trying to\nbe violent. Part of the blame\nfor this should lie with guitarist Dave Young, who co-wrote\nthese songs without giving\nhimself any good parts.\n3) There is too much inane\nmaterial. Hungry for Your\nLove is as banal as the title\nsuggests.\nThis album, however, does\nhave good points, such as\nCale's vocals, which growl\nalong admirably and contrast\nnicely with the music. Songs\nlike Experiment Number 1\nand Where There's a Will are\npiano ballads which are both\npretty and powerful. The\nalbum's title track is very soft,\nwith some lovely viola work by\nCale. The album even has twc\nsongs (Magazines and Villa\nAlbani) you can dance to.\nFor readers unfamiliar with\nCale's work, I would suggest\nFear, Sabotage, or Music for a\nNew Society, which all have\nthe rare ability to combine\nstunning beauty with raw\npower. For Mr. Cale, I would\nsuggest that he watch a few\nmore autopsies before recording his next album, as this\nstimuli has worked well for\nhim on past albums.\nDomestics Imports: New & used\n1869 W. 4th 738-3232 Visible Targets\t\n \u2022 Twilite Zoning\nBlO-Y IDpL\nMarch 29th \u2022 7:30pm\nwith special guests\nWar Memorial Gym U.ti.o.\nSponsored by\nLAMBIAWCE\n::21waterst. ?\n]\\ at Punch]ines ^\n! 0PEH^ooMARCHl5\nftiSMotx Stow\nMOBILE\nSOUND\nSYSTEM\nFor any^event call\n228-CITR\nThe Visible Targets have\ncertainly made a name for\nthemselves in the Pacific\nNorthwest during the past\nyear or two, and with the\nrecent release of their 5-song\nalbum Autistic Savant on Park\nAvenue Records, that name\ncould extend beyond the\nRocky Mountains.\n\"No, no, it's certainly not\npart of any grand plan. This is\na very up and down business .\nthinrjs change from day to\nday,\" states Pamela, a sentiment echoed by her sisters\nRebecca and Laura and drummer Ron Simmons. The four of\nthem were in Vancouver in\nearly February to play a\nweekend of gigs at the Railway Club and the Soft Rock\nCafe, and to promote the new\ndisc, which was recorded here\nin Vancouver at Mushroom\nStudios and produced by Mick\nRonson.\n.Why Vancouver? \"Well,\nit's always nice to get out of\ntown for a while, and we really\nlike Vancouver and the studio.\nMick had done some work at\nMushroom before, so it seemed like the logical place.\"\nThe Visible Targets originate from Yakima, Washington,    but   have   since   made\nRon\nSeattle their base. They've\nbeen together for almost four\nyears, and in that time have\nbecome one of the more\nprominent groups on the local\nscene. Autistic Savant is their\nsecond record release, and it\nhas recently been picked for\nnational distribution by Jem\nRecords in the United States.\nTime for the big break?\n\"Well, it's going to take a\nlot of exposure, and that\npretty well means a lot of\ntourino,\" states Rebecca, who\nplays bass for the band and\nshares the sinqina duties with\nPamela and Laura. Besides a\n\"few major world tours of\nWashington state,\" the Visible Targets have yet to venture farther south or east.\nTheir biggest touring coup to\ndate was backing up the\nSimple Minds on their last\nCanadian visit during the\nwinter of 1982-83. \"A great\nexperience - one that we\nenjoyed immensely. The\nSimple Minds were great to\nwork with. They were very\nempathetic toward us, being a\nback-up band and all.

First\nand foremost, the V.T.s are a\ntight and fast-paced ROCK 'N\nROLL band. Perhaps there is\nsomething to be said for the\nspecial chemistry between\nsiblings \u2014 it certainly works\nfor Rebecca, Laura and\nPamela.

Random Insomnia.\n(Random: chance, haphazard.\nInsomnia: prolonged or abnormal sleeplessness.) No\nother radio show has ever\nbeen called Random Insomnia\n(ever).\nAspect Number Two: The\ntime that it's on. Random\nInsomnia is on every Sunday\nmorning at 1 a.m. (that's late\nnight Saturday). In the eight\nor nine months that Random\nInsomnia has been on the air\nat CITR, no other radio show\nhas been on, in CITR's band,\nat the same time (except for\nthe one or two times that\nRandom Insomnia hasn't been\non and another show has\nreplaced it).\nAspect Number Three:\nRandom Insomnia is the only\nradio show ever (in the history\nof civilization) to be expressly\ndedicated to solving all the\nworld's problems.
